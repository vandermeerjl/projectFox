Overview 

This is my interactive fox made with the create.js. I used sprites to animate the fox and it runs using a random number. 

Click him at any time to play a random animation.

Please turn up your sound, you may hear something...

Make sure you show him some love or he will fall asleep!

But when he does sleeps, just click 5 times to wake him up!

Cool projects like this and more can be found on my portfolio website at www.jennifervandermeer.ca!
